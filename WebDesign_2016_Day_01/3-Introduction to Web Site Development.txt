Introduction to Web Site Development
==============================
The Internet, sometimes simply called the Net, is a global network connecting millions of computers. Within this network, a user who has permission at any one computer can access and obtain information from any other computer within the network.

The World Wide Web (WWW) consists of a system of global network servers, also known as Web servers, that support specially formatted documents and provide a means for sharing these resources with many people at the same time. A network server is known as the host computer, and your computer, from which you access the information, is called the client.

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) enables the transfer of data from the host computer to the client.

Accessing the Web requires a connection through a regional or national Internet service provider (ISP), an online service provider (OSP), or a wireless service provider (WSP).

Types of Web Sites
==============
Web sites are classified as 12 basic types:
1. Portal - provides a variety of Internet services from a single, convenient location.
2. News - contains news articles relating to current events.
3. Informational - contains factual information, such as research and statistics. Governmental agencies and nonprofit organizations are the primary providers of informational Web pages.
4. Business / Marketing  - contains content that promotes or sells products or services.
5. Educational - provides exciting, challenging avenues for formal and informal teaching and learning.
6. Entertainment - offers an interactive and engaging environment and contains music, video, sports, games, and other similar features.
7. Advocacy - offers content that describes a cause, opinion, question, or idea.
8. Blog (Web Log) - uses a regularly updated journal format to reflect the interests, opinions, and personality of the author and sometimes of site visitors.
9. Wiki - is a collaborative Web site that allows users to create, add to, modify, or delete the Web site content via their Web browser.
10. Social Networks - is an online community that encourages members to share their interests, stories, photos, music, and videos with other members. 
11. Content Aggregator - is a business that gathers and organizes Web content and then distributes the content to subscribers free or for a fee.
12. Personal - is published by an individual or family and generally is not associated with any organization. 


Planning a Web Site
===============
1. Planning Basics - Pruprose
	* Purpose and goal - Determine the purpose and goal of your Web site. Create a focus by developing a purpose statement, which communicates the intention of the Web site. Consider the 12 basic types of Web sites mentioned previously.

	** Target Audience - The people who visit your Web site will determine the success of your site. To learn more about the visitors to your Web site, determine whether you want to attract people with similar interests, and consider the gender, education, age range, income, profession/job field, and computer proficiency of your target audience. 

	*** Web Tecnhologies - Evaluate whether your potential visitors have access to high-speed broadband media or to baseband media, and use this information to determine what elements to include within your Web site. 

	*** Web Site Comparison - Visit other Web sites that are similar to your proposed site. What do you like about these sites? What do you dislike? Look for inspirational ideas. How can you make your Web site better?

2. Planning Basics - Content
	*  Value Added Content - Consider the different types of content you can include within your Web site

	** Text - Text accounts for the bulk of all content on most Web pages, so be brief and incorporate lists whenever possible.

	*** Images - After text, images constitute the next most commonly included content. 

	**** Color Palette - The color palette you select for your Web site can enhance or detract from your message or goal. Do not think in terms of your favorite colors. Instead, consider how color can support your goal.

	***** Multimedia (Plug-in/Add-on) - Multimedia adds interactivity and action to your Web pages. Animation, audio, and video are types of multimedia. If you plan to add multimedia, determine whether the visitor will require plug-ins or add-on.

Web Site Navigation - Predicting how a visitor will access a Web site or at what point the visitor will enter the Web site structure is not possible. Visitors can arrive at any page within a Web site by a variety of ways: a hyperlink, a search engine, a directory, typing a Web address directly, and so on. On every page of your Web site, you must provide clear answers to the three basic questions your visitors will ask: Where am I? Where do I go from here? How do I get to the home page? A well-organized Web site provides the answers to these questions. Once the visitor arrives at a Web site, navigation, the pathway through your site, must be obvious and intuitive.

Design Basics - Navigation Map 
=======================
A navigation map, or site map, outlines the structure of the entire Web site, showing all pages within the site and the connections from one page to the others. The navigation map acts as a road map through the Web site, but does not provide details of the content of the individual pages. 

The goal and the type of Web site often determine the structure selected for a specific Web site. Create a navigation map to serve as a blueprint for your navigational structure. Consider the following navigational structures and determine which one best meets your needs:

	*  Structure: 
	Linear - In a linear structure the user navigates sequentially, moving from one page to the next. Information that flows as a narrative, as a timeline, or in logical order is ideal for sequential treatment. Simple sequential organization, however, usually works only for smaller sites. Many online tutorials use a linear structure.

	Heirarchical - is one of the better ways to organize complex bodies of information efficiently. Because many visitors are familiar with hierarchical charts, many Web sites employ this structure.

	Web - which also is called a random structure, places few restrictions on organizational patterns. This type of structure is associated with the free flow of ideas and can be confusing to a user. A random structure is better suited for experienced users looking for further education or enrichment and is not recommended if your goal is to provide a basic understanding of a particular topic. If a Web site is relatively small, however, a random structure could work well.

	Grid - if your Web site consists of a number of topics of equal importance. Procedural manuals, events, and item lists work well in a grid structure.

	Hybrid - Large Web sites frequently use a hybrid structure, a combination of the previous listed structures, to organize information.

Development Basics * Typography, Images, Page Layout, and Color Typography, images, page layout, and color are the key design elements that will make up your fi nished Web site. Correct use of these elements plays an important part in the development process.
	* Typography As in all media, good typography, the appearance and arrangement of the characters that make up your text, is vital to the success of your Web page.

	** Images can enhance almost any Web page if used appropriately. Without the visual impact of shape, color, and contrast, Web pages can be visually uninteresting and will not motivate the visitor to investigate their contents

	*** Page Layout The importance of proper page layout cannot be overemphasized. A suitable design draws visitors to your Web site. Although no single design system is appropriate for all Web pages, establish a consistent, logical layout that allows you to add text and images easily.

	**** Color When creating a Web page, use color to add interest and vitality to your site. Include color in tables, as backgrounds, and with fonts. Use the right combination of colors to decorate the layout and tie the Web site pages together.


Reviewing and Testing the Web site 
==========================
This ongoing process ensures that you identify and correct any problems before publishing to the Web.
	* free from spelling and grammatical errors
	* no broken links 
	*  multimedia functions correctly
	* test the Web site with different broswers and versions

Publishing a Web site
================
After your Web site has been tested thoroughly, it can be published. Publishing a Web site, making it available to your visitors, involves the actual uploading of the Web site to a server. After you complete the uploading process, all pages within the Web site should be tested again.
	* Obtain a domain name

Maintaining the Web site
==================
Most Web sites require maintenance and updating. Some types of ongoing Web maintenance include the following:
	* Changing content, either by adding new text and images or by deleting obsolete material
	* Checking for broken links and adding new links
	* Documenting the last change date (even when no revisions have been made)
